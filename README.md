## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

The main thing I learned in this project was how to use an SVG, I've never used them before, and I still have a lot more to learn abou them as well.

### Continued development

I was unable to get the Eye to appear when the main image is hovered, I could have accomplished that useing JS but I know it's also possible just using css and would like to figure out how it is accomplished. I would like to learn more about SVG's and I was also unable to get the extra blue tint on the photo to go away when it is hovered, (there is a couple extra pixels of my blue box poking out from under the picture)
